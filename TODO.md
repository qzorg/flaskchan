# General Site

* Add different css effects for when users use different header-types in markdown inside of posts
    * Make a posting style-guide
* Make the rules window on /all/ toggle like the floating posting and reply boxes do (should be simple)

* Long filenames don't get truncated and cause the floating post/reply box to expand to the right
* Sometimes the floating rules window on /all/ won't fit on the page if there are too many rules
* /lewd/ threads show up on /all/ and the homepage's recent posts panel
* users can cause [non-existant threads to be loaded by the server](https://git.omnius.zone/omnius/omnius-zone/issues/14)
