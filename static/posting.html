	<h2> POSTING STYLES AND FORMATTING </h2>
	<div class="left_box">
	    &lt; Formatting: &gt;<br />
        <h4>Text Styles:</h4>
        <p>All of the styles below are "inline", meaning that if you do not create a new line on the next line after them, they will appear in the same line as the content before and after. The one exception would be quoting. Formatting in general is in markdown format, but this is listed here for the sake of convenience and to specify behaviours which deviate from what you would expect when posting in Markdown.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"# " at the beginning of a line makes bold text</li>
            <li>"## " at the beginning of a line makes red text</li>
            <li>"### " at the beginning of a line makes green text</li>
            <li>"#### " at the beginning of a line spoilers text</li>
            <li>"##### " at the beginning of a line italicizes and underlines text</li>
            <li>"###### " at the begining of a line will make text have large kerning</li>
             <ul>
                 <li>You can mark the end of any of these with a new line or by closing it with another octothorpe</li>
             </ul>
            <li>greater-than at the beginning of a line will quote</li>
            <li>a backtick (`) at the beginning and the end of a text segment will mark it as code</li>
            <li>an underscore or asterisk at the beginning and end of a text segment will italicize it</li>
            <li>two underscores or asterisks at the beginning and end of  a text segment will bolden it</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Blocks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>greater-than at the beginning of several lines in a row is a block-quote. These can include other elements inside of them, including more quotes.</li>
            <li>Ordered lists can be done by prefixing each line with a number, a period, and a comma. Like this: "1. Item 1"</li>
             <ul>
                 <li>Note: Starting any line with a number followed by a period, however long, will trigger this. To avoid triggering this you can type a backslash before the period.</li>
             </ul>
            <li>Unordered lists can be done by prefixing each line with a hyphen, a plus sign, or an asterisk. Like this: "- Unordered list item"</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Other Stuff:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A line with "***", "___", or "---" by itself will create a horizontal line. You can have more than three, but three is minimum to trigger it.</li>
            <li>To make a link, do this: Text, text, [Link,](https://purple.com/ "Show this on hover") normal text.</li>
            <li>To make a stand-alone clickable link for an email or site, do one of these:</li>
             <ul>
                 <li><https://purple.com> so basically just put angle brackets around it</li>
                 <li><rms@gnu.org></li>
             </ul>
            <li>You can also use a backslash to escape any of these: \,`,*,_,{},[],(),#,+,-,.,! But it isn't always needed.</li>
